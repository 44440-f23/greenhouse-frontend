## Overview

The current state of the project relies on real-time sensor data through a serial connection. For it to work as expected, you need to have either an ESP-32 sending json to COM port 5, or some phony json being sent every once in a while. 

When trying to run the app the first time, it may fail, but it seems to always work on the second try. I think it is an issue with reading the serial port from the start, maybe the garbage characters that are sent from our ESP-32?
